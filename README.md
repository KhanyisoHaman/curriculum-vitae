# curriculum-vitae
A curriculum vitae is a written overview of a person's experience and other qualifications for a job opportunity. It is akin to a Résumé in North America

Build a resume website that will impress every hiring manager who sees it.
 
Introduction
When you apply for a job you need to show the hiring manager what skills you have and at the same time let them know more about yourself. Traditionally, this is done using a printed CV, and more recently, people use online platforms like LinkedIn to showcase their skills and experience. However, YOU now have the skills to create a personalised and modern version: a resume website.
